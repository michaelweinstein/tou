/**
 * This class is only instantiated once in the project because
 * it stores all the loaded resources, like Sprites, that can then be accessed
 * by the other classes. It works as like a library, so that the
 * sprites only have to be loaded once.
 * 
 * It is abstract because it does not store the specific data, it only
 * builds the architecture of a subclass that will store the specific data.
 * Since this class is generic, it cannot instantiate a SpriteLoader because
 * it does not know the files, or the necessary metadata to read the sprites 
 * from the sprite sheet. This mostly acts as a superclass for the game
 * Resources subclasses, which are the ones that load the actual data and
 * store them for the rest of the game to receive. It is a very important
 * class because this ensures that all of the Sprites are only loaded once.
